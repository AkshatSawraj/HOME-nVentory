## What project is it?

> This web application helps homeowners keep track of their inventory of household items for insurance purposes. I created this project in the third semester of college <a href="https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/diplomas/information-technology" target='_blank'>(SAIT)</a>.

If a user forgets their password, they will have the option to reset their password. If they choose to reset a password, they will receive an email containing a link which will send them to a page to enter a new password.

Manage Inventory:

A home inventory item consists of category, name, and price. Users can view, add, delete and edit their own items.
Manage Users, Roles and Categories:

A system administrator is able to manage all aspects of the system below. A company administrator, on the other hand, can only manage users of the same company as them.
